#Asynchronous Javascript - Exploring Callbacks, Promises and Generators
============

1. Level one: Programming with callbacks - you make it work, but it's ugly
2. Level two: Programming with abstracted callbacks - cleaner for sure, but still messy and way too much repeated code
3. Level three: Promises - much cleaner much more stable code, but still not as enjoyable as code should be
4. Level four: Generators - life is good.

This is a javascript promises tutorial / javascript generators tutorial. We're going to show the four levels and why each level is better than the one before it. Along the way, you should learn a decent bit about promises, and even some about generators.

## Installation
```shell
$ git clone https://www.github.com/seangeleno/asyncJS
$ cd asyncJS
$ atom .
```

## Usage
Open index.html in your browser and uncomment the bottom scripts, one at a time. They all do the same thing but are written using different javascript concepts.

###Google Chrome only supports http or https request so it wont work if loading from localhost.

You must upload it online otherwise, here is a link:
